## Terpene Synthases (TPS)

The gene IDs for the initial analysis were obtained from the supplamentary table of this [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-00787-9). I got the protein sequences for all the gene IDs from [PlantApp](https://www.plantapp.org/SQNce/proteins). I expect that some of the 43 TPS sequences will need some additional work in the future. Using [ColabFold-batch](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/batch/AlphaFold2_batch.ipynb#scrollTo=hUYApPElB30u) (v1.5.5, Jan 30th, 2024) to run all the prediction, generating five models for each sequence.
